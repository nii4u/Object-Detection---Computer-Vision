# Object-Detection---Computer-Vision

This project uses the COCO dataset and ImageNet to track objects in a chain of images. The Detectron is used to track objects in subsequent frames by assigning unique tracking numbers and a dedicated color to the objects. Each detected object is bounded by a bounding box, and each instance comes with a prediction using the computation of Intersection Over Union(IOU)
